ES6 concepts and Object oriented programming
    Reading Eloquent Javascript
        Number:
        Javascript use 64 bits to represent Number.
        Special numbers: Infinity, -Infinity, NaN
        Infinity - Infinity = NaN
        0/0 = NaN
        There is only on number that is not equal to itself, that is NaN
        NaN is used to denote the result of nonsensical computation, and such, it 
        isnt equal to result of any other nonsensical computation
        NaN == NaN returns false

        String:
        Javascript use 16 bits to represent String.
        Unicode - standard that gives a number for each and every character that ever need.
        Javascript represent String as sequence of these respective numbers for characters.
        Special characters - like emoji may not be represented in 16 bits in Javascript.
        Javascript use 2 16bits to represent these special characters.

        String comarision
        'A' < 'Z' returns true
        Javascript goes from left to right character by character and compare the Unicode number
        Uppercase letters are always less than lower case letters

        Emty values:
        Javascript has two special values, null and undefined.
        These are used to denote absense of meaningful values. They are themselves values but caryy no information.
        Both can be used interchangebly
